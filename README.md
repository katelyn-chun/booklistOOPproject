# My Personal Project

## Who, What, and Why?

My application will be a book tracker for the user to **add, rate, link, and sort**
books they have read. This project is designed for *anyone who is an active reader*.
It may also be useful to students who would like to use it for keeping track
of the online journal articles they have read, or textbooks to keep track of. I am interested in this
project because I would like a simple application to record my reading history.
Not only would it be helpful to look back on, but it would be fun to see my past ratings
for the books.
